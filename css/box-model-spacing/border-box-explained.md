### ⭐Alternative CSS Box Model

- border-box
- `box-sizing: border-box`

- 📌[Base Styles](Base-Styles.md)
- 📌To use the alternative box model for all of your elements (which is a common choice among developers)

  ```css
  html {
  	box-sizing: border-box;
  }
  *,
  *::before,
  *::after {
  	box-sizing: inherit;
  }
  ```

  - separates the reset from the global styling of all elements
    - explicitly sets the box-sizing for the root element and lets the rest inherit it
    - can be seen as a form of organization, especially if you have other global styles applied to the `<html>` element
